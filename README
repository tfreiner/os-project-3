OS Project 3
Repo. https://github.com/tfreiner/os-project-3

To run this project, type make to create the executable 'oss' and then type 'oss' followed by the options and arguments.
There are 4 options: -h(help), -s(processes), -t(time) and -l(filename).
-s and -t are optional
-s has been limited to be less than 25 since the max number of current processes per user is 30 and this ensures that number won't be exceeded.

This program runs quickly and it is rare that it will last -t time.
To test the -t implementation, one thing to do is change the nanosecond incrementation on lines 184, 185, and 189 in oss.c from 5000 to 1,
uncomment line 170 in oss.c, and run the program with these commands: oss -t 1 -s 1 -l outfile.
Then it will usually reach 1 second and stop execution.
